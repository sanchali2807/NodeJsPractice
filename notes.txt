node js run on v8 engine and written in c++ code
it is a non blocking , does not wait around for io operations , used events loop and callbacks for it to be non blocking 
a single main thread that executes 
use event loop to perform non blocking io operations 
Node.js does not wait for an asynchronous operation to complete. It continues executing other code, and once the operation finishes, its callback is queued and executed later by the event loop.
console.log("1") → printed immediately

setTimeout(...)
Timer is started in background
JS moves on immediately
console.log("3") → printed immediately
After 1 second:
Callback is placed in task queue
Event loop checks:
Call stack empty? ✅
Execute callback
console.log("2") runs




in case of using module.exports for function do not need to write parathesis and in index.js use require to import it



now for es modules that is import export syntax so in package.json file add type to module
if not exported using default while importing need to use curly bracket and need to write .js or an error will come saying could not find the module


setHeader is for content type like text plain or html and status code to send a status code 
to use these two at the same time and not to write in two diff lines used writeHead()


okk so the node modules that are insatlled on downloading any package if deleted can be istalled using only npm install as the package installed is saved as a dependency in the package .json
